# IntpartSummerSchool2019

This summer school report includes the main astrophysical processes to produce elements in the cosmos. In particular, the connection of nuclear physics data to astrophysical relevant cross sections, including hands-on exercise with the state-of-the-art TALYS reaction code, to deepen the understanding of the interplay of nuclear physics and astrophysics. The course was arranged as a Summer school from the 25th of November to the 6th of December 2019 in Kruger park in South Africa. Details of the Course and School can be found in the link: [Advanced Nuclear Reactions and Applications to Astrophysics]{https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/nuclear-shapes-and-resonances-in-education/summer-schools/southafrica-2019/}.
