# IntpartSummerSchool2019

This summer school report includes the main astrophysical processes to produce elements in the cosmos. In particular, the connection of nuclear physics data to astrophysical relevant cross sections, including hands-on exercise with the state-of-the-art TALYS reaction code, to deepen the understanding of the interplay of nuclear physics and astrophysics.
